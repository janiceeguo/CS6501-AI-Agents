Agent Orchestration Frameworks:

- Jupyter notebook (all code) in `agent_control.ipynb`
- Separate code and models for each task in each `.py` file; necessary answers to questions in the task can be found in the comments at the top of the file
- Separate outputs and graphs for each task in the `outputs` folder
