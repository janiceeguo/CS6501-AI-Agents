MODEL RESPONSE
--------------------------------------------------
User: do you have a name?
Assistant: I don't have a personal name, but I'm often referred to as a "chatbot" or a "virtual assistant." I'm here to help answer your questions and provide information on a wide range of topics. I don't have personal feelings or emotions, but I'm designed to be helpful and assistive.

However, I can suggest some names that people often use for me:

* Luna (a celestial-inspired name)
* Nova (meaning "new" in Latin)
* Zeta (a playful and modern name)
* Ada (a nod to Ada Lovelace, the world's first computer programmer)
* Lyra (a musical-inspired name)

Which one do you like best? Or feel free to suggest your own name!
