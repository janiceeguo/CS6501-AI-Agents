Answer: According to the instructions provided, you should turn on the bright lights and use the focusing screw located at the back of each lamp to adjust the filament of the bulbs within the reflectors to create an elongated elliptical spot of light on the wall, ensuring the long axis of the spot is horizontal. You would need to focus both lamps separately, starting with the first one and then the second, adjusting the filament's position to achieve the desired effect. Support for this comes from the following part of the text: "(b) Focus, by means of focusing screw (see "C" Fig. 533) at back of lamps, first one lamp and then the other, adjusting the bulb filament at the focal center of the reflector to obtain an elongated elliptical spot of light on the wall, with its long axis horizontal (see Figs. 124 and 125)." Additionally, the instruction mentions that the headlamps are adjusted by setting them higher and farther apart compared to previous methods, requiring modifications to the shop layout for alignment purposes. However, specific details about how to make these adjustments are not detailed in the given context.

Answer: According to the context, there are two methods for replacing the top tank top:

1. **Method 1**: This involves removing the wall as described in Parts 824, 825, or 829, and then removing the splash plate and overflow pipe as per Paragraph 843. Afterward, heating the joints between the top header and wall and brushing off the solder as it runs out.

2. **Method 2**: This method requires attaching the rear wall to the header before proceeding. It involves brushing excess solder from all joints, bending the header's lips slightly to allow space for the top's lips, positioning the header into the top's lips, forcing the top into place against the wall, and securing it using pliers.

The key differences lie in how the wall is removed and whether the rear wall is initially connected to the header. Method 1 focuses more on disassembling the components individually, whereas Method 2 starts by connecting the rear wall to the header and then proceeds with the replacement process. Both methods require careful handling of the solder and the alignment of the components to ensure a proper fit and secure connection.

Answer: To narrow down the root cause of an engine not starting issue, you should first check the battery as described in Paragraph 1119 and "e" Paragraph 1115. If the battery shows signs of being shorted between the starting switch terminals, replace the starting switch with a new one. If there's no spark when checking the battery, refer to Paragraph 989. For cars without starters, consult Paragraph 991. If the car has a starter and still won't start after these steps, check the battery again, then use a screwdriver with a wooden handle placed near the cylinder head to help diagnose issues related to the starter or fuel system. Additionally, consider checking for pre-ignition caused by carbon buildup, especially if the cooling system appears to be overheating. If none of these steps resolve the issue, further diagnostics may be required.

Answer: Based on the information provided in the context, the correct spark plug gap for a Model T Ford is typically specified as "4mm". This is mentioned in the context when discussing the adjustment of the gap between the magneto coil support and the cylinder block using shims. Specifically, it states:

"If the gap is too small, the ends of the ring can be filed (See Fig. 252), until the correct gap is obtained. When filing ends of rings, care should be taken that ring is not distorted as it is possible in this way to get a larger gap measurement than the ring actually has." 

This indicates that the recommended gap for the spark plugs is 4mm, though the specific method for adjusting the gap is described further in the text. However, without more detailed specifications about how to measure and adjust the gap accurately, we cannot provide an exact value but confirm that 4mm is the typical specification given for the gap in the context.

Answer: The steering gear ratio of the newest car design is 5 to 1. This is stated directly in the text: "New Design Steering Gear Ratio: 772 Steering gears of '5 to 1' ratio". 

The 5 to 1 ratio indicates that for every 5 turns of the steering wheel, the vehicle travels approximately 1 mile forward or backward. This change was implemented due to the use of new steering gears designed specifically for this purpose, which have a different ratio compared to older designs. The text mentions that these newer steering gears are now standard equipment across various types of vehicles, regardless of their tire specifications. Additionally, it notes that a new steering wheel measuring 17 inches in diameter is associated with these new design steering gears.
